These are the major programming Methodologies

1. Agile Software Development

In 2001, seventeen software developers made history by signing the Agile Manifesto. Since then, agile software development has taken off; in fact, in a 201


2. Scrum

Agile software development comes in many flavors, and Scrum is one of the most popular with 70 percent of respondents to the 2015 State of Agile report saying that they practice Scrum or a Scrum hybrid. It's a framework for collaboration that was first invented by Jeff Sutherland in 1993. It divides complex projects into short two- to four-week sprints, and it emphasizes the values of courage, focus, commitment, respect and openness.


3. Lean Software Development

Although lean development is commonly associated with agile, the principles of lean actually arose from Toyota's lean manufacturing processes. This development methodology relies on seven key principles: eliminate waste, increase feedback, delay commitment, deliver fast, build integrity in, empower the team and see the whole. Lean first came to the attention of the software development community in 2003 with the publication of Mary and Tom Poppendieck's book "Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit."


4. Kanban

Another variation of agile software development that was inspired by Toyota, Kanban gives developers a visual way to see what work needs to be done and allows them to "pull" in work as they have capacity rather than "pushing" them to complete certain tasks. It relies on three core principles: visualize what you do today, limit the amount of work in progress and enhance flow.
